# HORTICULTURE - ANALYSIS OF AREA PRODUCTION AND PRODUCTIVITY OF SPICES FROM 2008-2011
## OVERVIEW
1. Horticulture is the art of cultivating plants in gardens to produce food and 
medicinal ingredients, or for comfort and ornamental purposes. 
2. Horticulturists grow flowers, spices, fruits and nuts, vegetables and herbs, as well as ornamental trees and lawns. 
3. In this project, I am going to analyse the area production and productivity of spices from 2008 - 2011 data and make a storyboard report using Tableau to understand the production and productivity of spices effectively. 
## PURPOSE
To unlock the insights that are not visible before, understand the patterns much 
more effectively in the data, present the data in much more presentable form that can be easily 
understand by Horticulturists to take certain decisions effectively. 
## ABOUT DATASET
1. The dataset downloaded from data.gov.in website. 
2. The dataset contains the data about the area production and productivity of spices from 2008 - 2011.

1. Tableau is a powerful and fastest growing data visualization tool used in the Business Intelligence Industry. 
2. It helps in simplifying raw data in a very easily understandable format. 
3. Tableau helps create the data that can be understood by professionals at any level in an organization. 
4. It also allows non-technical users to create customized dashboards. 
5. Data analysis is very fast with Tableau tool and the visualizations created are in the form of 
dashboards and worksheets. 
### THE BEST FEATURES OF TABLEAU SOFTWARE
* Data Blending
* Realtime Analysis
* Collaboration of data

## PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
### 1. EXPORT EXCEL FILE INTO TABLEAU
1. The dataset is in the form of excel file.
2. Export this excel file into Tableau for analysis.
### 2. ANALYZE DATA AND CREATE VISUALIZATIONS USING TABLEAU
1. After exporting the excel file into the Tableau, start analysing the data.
2. After analyzing the data, create beautiful visualizations using different charts available in Tableau.
### 3. CREATE INTERACTIVE DASHBOARDS
1. Once created the visualizations, create different interactive dashboards using the visualizations.
### 4. CREATE STORYBOARD
1. Once created the dashboards, create a storyboard that will tell a story of the project.
### RESULT
The result of the project is the interactive Storyboard.
